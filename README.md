# MiSTle boards

The MiSTle projects can be used with off-the-shelf components and
some breadboard setup.

To simplify this the MiSTeryNano project provides additional
hardware:

  - The [MiSTeryShield20k](misteryshield20k) is a base board for
  the Tang Nano 20k and the M0S Dock with a DB9 joystick connector and
  MIDI ports

  - [MiSTeryShield20k RPiPico](misteryshield20k_rpipico) is a board similar to the [MiSTeryShield20k](misteryshield20k) but using a Raspberry Pi Pico instead of the M0S Dock and with a USB hub already built-in

  - The [MiSTeryShield20k lite](misteryshield20k_lite) is also a base
  board for the Tang Nano 20k. It includes the RP2040 and a USB-A
  port and is a minimal all-in-one solution for the Tang Nano 20k.

  - The [PMOD M0S](m0s_pmod) allows to use the M0S Dock (BL616 ÂµC) on a PMOD
  port as e.g. available on the  
  Tang Primer 20K, Primer 25K, Mega 60k/138K NEO, Mega138kPro, Console 60k/138k

  - The [PMOD PiZero](pizero_pmod) is a board similar to the [M0S PMOD](m0s_pmod) using a Raspberry Pi Pico compatible RP2040-ZERO board instead of the M0S Dock

  - The [PMOD PiPico](pipico_pmod) is a board similar to the [M0S PMOD](m0s_pmod) using a Raspberry Pi Pico (W)ifi instead of the M0S Dock

  - The [Atari ST Keyboard](atarist_keyboard) design is a tiny 50% Atari ST style keyboard which is meant to become the basis for a Mini Atari ST

  - The [T20 PMOD](t20_pmod) is an add-on for the Efinix T20BGA256 development board adding a PMOD for HDMI usage, the SD card slot and a Raspberry Pi PICO incl. USB-A header to it making it a complete MiSTeryNano setup.

  - The [MiSTeryDev20k](misterydev20k) is meant to become a
  first test of a complete all-in-one board for the GW2AR-LV18 FPGA
  (the same one as on the Tang Nano 20k).

  - [MisteryShield20k DS2 Adapter](misteryshield20k_ds2_adapter) is an add-on for the [MiSTeryShield20k](misteryshield20k) allowing to connect Playstation Dualshock 2 Game controllers to it

Further hardware is available in related projects:

  - [MisteryNano Case](https://github.com/prcoder-1/MiSTeryNano-Case) is a 3d printable case design for the bare Tang Nano 20k (no shields) with room and mounting instructions for expansion connectors and an optional M0S Dock
